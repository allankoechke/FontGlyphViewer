# QML-Based Font Glyphs Viewer
The application allows for the loading of ttf/otf-based font formats for viewing as well as copying the Unicode character associated with a specific glyph. This is important if you are trying to figure out what a specific icon font contains or the specific Unicode to use to utilize font icons.

Font icons are a popular way of distributing and embedding vector-based icons. Some popular font-based icon sets include [Font Awesome](www.fontawesome.com), [Material Fonts]() and so much more!
